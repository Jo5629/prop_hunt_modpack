# Prop Hunt

As of May 26, 2025, everyone **MUST** be at Luanti 5.12 or higher. I tested a little bit and you can not see the person when they turn into a node for people that are **NOT** at 5.12.

## Prop Hunt Stick

- Requires the `prop_hunt` privilege.
- Leftclick a node to change into it.
- Shift + leftclick to exit.
- Rightclick to snap to the nearest node.

## Commands

- `/prop_hunt enter <nodename>`
  - Turn into `nodename`.
- `/prop_hunt exit`
  - Turn back into the player.
- `/prop_hunt snap`
  - Snap to the nearest node.
